This repository contains code used to generate results and figures for the manuscript "Global health risks lurking in livestock resistome"

Antibiotic resistance is a serious global health challenge and there is growing consensus that improved environmental surveillance could provide valuable information to inform local, national and international antibiotic resistance stewardship efforts.  Livestock farming consumes over 70% of global antibiotics annually, making livestock manures an important vector of anthropogenically-influenced antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs).

In the main brach, you can found all the codes and scripts for annotation, analysis and visulization in our study. All the data for analysis and visualization will be uploaded as demos respectively, once our study is published.

Unfortunately, because of the limits of GitHub on uploading the files bigger than 25 Mb, we can not upload all the reference nucleotide sequence we used. If you need you can contanct me by the following E-mails without any hesitation: bintao.li@nwafu.edu.cn.
